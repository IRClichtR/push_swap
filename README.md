On string_version_brocken

Branch string_version_brocken is an attempt to set the return value of push_swap as a char string containing all moves done by the program.
The process of creating that string was not optimized since it demanded a lot debug for leak and invalid free errors.
To validate the project in a reasonable time with regard to my current capabilities, I set the return to void. 
Every move is printed directly using the write function through ft_printf.
